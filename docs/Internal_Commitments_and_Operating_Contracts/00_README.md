# Internal Commitments & Operating Contracts

This package defines the internal promises, constraints, and operating contracts
governing how we build, ship, and manage the Desktop and Cloud versions of the
Deep Operational Assistant.

Audience:
- Founders
- Core engineering
- Product leadership
- Future operators

These are internal commitments, not marketing documents.
