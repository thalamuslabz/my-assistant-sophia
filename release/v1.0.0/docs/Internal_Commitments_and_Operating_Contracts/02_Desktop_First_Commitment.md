# Desktop-First Commitment

## Statement
The desktop application is the primary product surface for v1 and v2.

## Commitments
- Desktop is never treated as a wrapper for a web app.
- All core functionality must be usable from desktop.
- Cloud features must never require abandoning desktop.

## Guardrails
- No desktop-only feature divergence.
- No degraded desktop experience.
