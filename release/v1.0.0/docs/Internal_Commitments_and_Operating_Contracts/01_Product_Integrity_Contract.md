# Product Integrity Contract

## Purpose
Ensure the product remains a trusted assistant, not a feature dump or automation toy.

## Commitments
- We do not ship features that undermine trust.
- We do not silently change assistant behavior.
- We do not auto-enable automation without explicit consent.
- We prioritize clarity over cleverness.

## Non-Negotiables
- Explainability is required for all actions.
- Undo / correction must always exist.
- Pause must always be respected.
